    This example illustrates how quoFEM interacts with the Tcl interpreter for
    OpenSees. A simple forward propagation procedure is run to estimate the
    first and second central moments of a FE model's response, given the
    marginal distributions of various random parameters.

    In this example, Bayesian estimation is used to estimate the lateral story
    stiffnesses of the two stories of a simple steel frame, given data about its
    mode shapes and frequencies. The transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo
    algorithm is used to obtain samples from the posterior probability
    distribution of the lateral story stiffnesses
